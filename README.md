  - Save images in a user-specified format.

- **Display Negative Image:**
  - Visualize the negative version of an image.

- **Rotate Image:**
  - Rotate images by a specified angle.

- **Resize Image:**
  - Change the size of an image by specifying dimensions or a percentage.

- **Manual Selection:**
  - Manually select regions in an image using rectangles or freehand selections.

- **Binarize Images:**
